## Unity ML-Agents
Unity Machine Learning Agents (ML-Agents) is an open-source Unity plugin that enables games and simulations to serve as environments
for training intelligent agents.

Through out this implementation we will use Unity's rich environments to design, train, and evaluate deep reinforcement learning 
algorithms. You can read more about ML-Agents by perusing the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents).
